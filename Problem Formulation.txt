1. States: 
- There are various legal board states to the game of Gipf. Let's start with the types
  of starting boards. There are a total of three types, one for each variation of Gipf. 
  The basic, standard, and tournament rules. The basic and standard rules follow the idea
  of having each player start with three pieces positioned on the angulars (corners) of the
  board such that every corner is an alternating color. In other words, each player takes turns
  (with white being the first) placing their three pieces onto the corners in an alternating
  order (white, black, white, etc). The ONLY difference with the standard rules as opposed to
  the basic rules is that, the starting three pieces in standard are the GIPF-pieces. As for the 
  tournament version, there is NO starting positions for the GIPF-pieces AND there can be any number
  of GIPF-pieces put into play as long a standard piece isn't played yet. Basically, a player can 
  start their GIPF-pieces wherever they'd like.
- To continue the different types of states for in game play, there are many diffent legal ones.
  The combanation of states depends on the game rules. Basic will be every combination of the 36 
  pieces on the board, standard the 24 normal and 6 gipfs, and tournament anywhere from 36 
  normal to 18 gipfs.
- Additional information we can store about the state are the number of pieces the opponent has
  left. This is vital for calculating an evaluation of every state up to the choosen cut-off depth.
